Avoid These Common Mistakes When Renting a Dumpster in #State<h2>
We want you to win. And winning means avoiding the stupid, costly mistakes that most people make when they rent a dumpster for the first time.<list>
The "I'll Just Get the Smallest One" Mistake. This is the classic blunder. You try to save $50 by getting a 10 yard when you know you probably need a 20 yard. Then you run out of space, and you have to pay for a whole second dumpster rental. You just turned a $400 project into an $800 one. Don't do it. When in doubt, size up. It's the smartest insurance you can buy.^^
The "I'll Just Chuck It In" Mistake. You just start heaving stuff in, creating a giant, jumbled mess with huge empty pockets of wasted space. This is how you run out of room fast.^^
The "It's a Magic Box" Mistake. You think you can throw anything in there paint, tires, chemicals. You can't. Prohibited items will get you hit with serious environmental fees from the landfill.^^
The "Blocking the Spot" Mistake. You forget the dumpster is coming and leave your car in the driveway. Our driver can't drop it. Now you’ve just earned yourself a "trip fee" for a wasted journey.

How to Load a Dumpster Efficiently and Safely<h2>
Loading your roll off dumpster container in #State isn't just about getting rid of junk; it’s about maximizing your investment. You paid for every square inch of that space. Use it.<list>
Use the Door! Don't be a hero trying to lift a heavy dresser over the side. Most of our dumpsters have a walk-in door at the back. Open it up, and walk your heavy items in first. Place them at the front (the end closest to the truck).^^
Think Like a Tetris Master. Load your big, flat items first things like drywall, plywood, or broken-down furniture. Create a flat base layer. Then, add your bulkier items.^^
Fill the Gaps. Use your smaller, looser junk to fill in the empty spaces between the bigger items.^^
Keep it Level. Never, ever load the dumpster higher than the top rails. It must be level for us to transport it safely and legally. A level load is a smart load.
